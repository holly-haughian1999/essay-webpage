    <h1 id="headerfont">Has Sir Tim Berners-Leeâ€™s invention of the World Wide Web, changed our lives for the better or worse?</h1>

   
<h3 id="headerfont">Introduction</h3>

<p id="font">
  There is no question as to how big of an impact the World Wide Web has had on the world. In a report by J.Clements, it was stated that 4.48 billion people were active on the internet by October 2019. The sheer scale of the impact isn't the argument, it is whether this impact of the World Wide Web, has changed our lives for the better or worse? The web has turned the world upside down, in almost everything we do we use the internet, whether it be finding a location on the map, keeping up to date with celebrity gossip or watching your favourite TV series. 
Everywhere we turn we see examples of the Web being made use of, to view this webpage you would have used the World Wide Web, it is all around us and without us realising sometimes. There are a range of different impacts it has had on society, both positive and negative, ranging from the unfortunate risk of cyber bullying, to the creation of many jobs. There is no doubt the world would be lost without the World Wide Web. However, opinions regarding the impact of it are mixed, in this essay I will discuss whether this invention has changed our lives for the better or worse.
