      <h3 id="headerfont">Has Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s invention of the World Wide Web, changed our lives for the better or worse?</h3>
      <p id="font">There is no question as to how big of an impact the World Wide Web has had on the world. In a report by J.Clements, it was stated that 4.48 billion people were active on the internet by October 2019 (Clement, J. 2019). The sheer scale of the impact isn't the argument, it is whether this impact of the World Wide Web, has changed our lives for the better or worse? The web has turned the world upside down, in almost everything we do we use the internet, whether it be finding a location on the map, keeping up to date with celebrity gossip or watching your favourite TV series. 
        Everywhere we turn we see examples of the Web being made use of, to view this webpage you would have used the World Wide Web, it is all around us and without us realising sometimes. There are a range of different impacts it has had on society, both positive and negative, ranging from the unfortunate risk of cyber bullying, to the creation of many jobs. There is no doubt the world would be lost without the World Wide Web. However, opinions regarding the impact of it are mixed, in this essay I will discuss whether this invention has changed our lives for the better or worse.

          <h3 id="headerfont">The Beginnings of the World Wide Web</h3>
          <p id="font">Firstly, before discussing the views of the Web, I want to discuss what it actually is. It began back in 1989, when Sir Tim-Berners Lee published “Information Management: A Proposal”. This paper brought together both hypertext and the Internet, creating the World Wide Web, a universal system made for sharing and disbursing information. (BBC, 2014) Tim included HTML, URL and HTTP in his proposal for making the web, all of which are still in use today in the world. He began to use a software called Enquire, which then led on to the idea of connecting society and its ideas and technology. The Web came together from ideas by many people, 
            </p>
            <blockquote id="font">“The Web arose as an answer to an open challenge, through the swirling together of influences, ideas, and realisations from many sides.”(Berners-Lee, T. 1999)</blockquote>
            <p id="font">Sir Tim Berners-Lee was born on the 8th June 1955 in London. He completed his studies of Physics at Queen’s College in Oxford. While many think the World Wide Web is the internet, this is not the case. The internet is a collection of global networks, while the world wide web is a system used to access the information from the internet, it acts as a tool allowing us to use the internet. </p>

<!---POSITIVE IMPACT-->


        

        <div class="positive" id="positive">
            <div class="wrap2">
              <h2 id="headerfont">Positive Impacts</h2>
                  <p id="font">
                      I believe the invention of the World Wide Web has greatly impacted our lives for the better for many reasons, it has connected the world and enabled us to share, communicate and retrieve information more affectively, through tools such as social media platforms, email and more. The World Wide Web was created with the purpose of being accessible to all, enabling many individuals to surf the web daily. When Sir Tim Berners Lee was asked “What’s the best thing to come from the Internet?” He replied with;
                      </p>
                      <blockquote id="font">“The spirit of global collaboration among all the people working on it.”(Berners-Lee, T. 2018) </blockquote>
            </div>
            <div class="left2">
                  <p id="font">The World Wide Web has opened the internet up to everyone. To argue this, I do think there is the potential of the web to be harmful, it can potentially lea to Internet Addiction. Another reason I believe Sir Tim Berners Lee’s invention of the World Wide Web has impacted us for the better, is the communication opportunities it has created, through the web and social media. This has increased the potential to add value to our relationships as human beings, e.g. long-distance relationships or having moved away from family, social media enables users to stay in touch and share experiences seamlessly. Without the internet, friendships and relationships may weaken as communication wouldn’t be as instant and accessible. In addition, social media has opened communication within businesses and can act as a great marketing tool, many businesses start up and expand through their social media accounts by advertising their products and services. Businesses can also interact and make transactions with other companies more effectively, therefore promoting their business. With regards to this, the invention of the World Wide Web has changed our lives for the better.

                      From a personal perspective, Sir-Tim Berners-Lee’s invention has greatly impacted my life for the better. Without the invention of the World Wide Web, we wouldn’t have access to the internet, and without this I wouldn’t be on the career path I am currently on. I depend on the Web and Internet as an aspiring UX designer, the tools and websites out there that assist me in this are endless. This brings me to another point of how the Web has greatly impacted our education. Majority of students use the Internet as a tool in their Education, whether this be for research, uploading their work, creating presentations and more. Some may say this puts those who don’t have access to the internet at a disadvantage, however, schools and universities tackle this by providing free access to it from laptops and computers.

<!---HARMFUL IMPACTS-->
<div class="negative" id="negative" style="height: 1450px;">
    <div id="center" style="width: 400px;">
    
              <h3 id="headerfont">Harmful Impacts</h3>
              <p id="font">Despite all of the positive impacts the World Wide Web has on society, there is the argument that it has impacted our lives for the worse. I previously mentioned how using the internet can lead to internet addiction, this is where the internet interferes with the user’s daily life, negatively affecting them psychologically, educationally or socially. A study completed with 1149 postgraduate students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, showed that “13% of the students were exposed to the internet addiction and only 0.4% of internet addiction was observed among the students”. (Reza Soleymani.M, Garivani.A, Zare-Farashband.F. 2016).  I believe this is a concerning statistic and although this is an issue, 86.6% of the students were able to make use of the Web effectively and beneficially in their studies and daily life. </p>
                <p id="font">In my opinion another growing problem with the Web and Internet, is the worryingly high numbers of users experiencing cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is bullying that takes place online, it can be carried out through social network, messaging/chat rooms, gaming sites etc. This type of bullying comes in many forms, such as harassment, cyber stalking, impersonation and more. The effects it can leave on the victims can negatively impact them socially, emotionally and potentially harm their education. It is too easy for harmful information to be shared targeting an individual, including celebrities. Many celebrities face the daily pressure of holding a social image, and if this fails, they’re put in the spotlight and receive disgraceful abuse, which I think is disheartening. An international anti-bullying charity called Ditchthelabel, stated that an estimated 5.43 million young users in the UK have experienced cyber bullying, with a shocking 1.26 million people suffering extreme cyber bullying. (Ackroyd, B. 2019). These distressing statistics make us question the invention of the World Wide Web and create a negative image towards it. To tackle this, many preventions have been put in place, talks in schools take place around the country regarding how to properly use the internet. It can also be reported to services such as Online Watchdogs and the police.

                    Another potentially harmful impact the World Wide Web has is the possible invasion of user’s privacy. Individuals have the right to protect themselves online, in spite of this, sometimes viruses can gain access into the user’s computer system and access personal information they have stored or track the user’s actions online. However, Sir Tim Berners-Lee stated in his book ‘Weaving the Web’, that every responsible website will have a privacy policy, that can be accessed by the user. (Berners-Lee, T. 1999).
